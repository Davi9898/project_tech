Welcome to the Gaming matching application : Gameting

This github contains the code for the inlog feature which I have created for project TECH at 'Hogeschool van Amsterdam'. For this project we had to create a matching application and create one of its features.
I chose to create the inlog and register feature for this application. This project contains NodeJS, Express , EJS and a **MONGODB** connection.

# H1 Installation 

To install this application you start with openening your code editor and select a new folder for this project. You can either clone the repository : *gh repo clone Davi9898/project_tech*
